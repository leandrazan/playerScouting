# playerScouting

In the pdf 'ClusteringDefenders'
(or here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/leandrazan/playerScouting/blob/main/ClusteringDefenders.html)
defenders that played in the English Championship season 22/23 are profiled through clustering.

Three groups are found, that characterise the players into 

- defenders with good positioning and 'safe' playing style (able to clear, block shots, win ground and aerial duels)
 while not taking too many risks (few tackles, fouls; high pass completion rates, few failed or dispossessed carries)
 (Group 1)
- defenders with less safe playing style and positiong (more tackles and fouls, less blocked shots and clearances, 
 less good at arial and ground duels), more risk affine in general (also more crosses into penalty area) 
 (Group 2)
 - defenders that have good ball playing qualities (high pass completion rates) and make progression through carries 
 as well as the classic defending skills (group 3)


### To do
- try to adjust some of the defending metrics for ball possession
- use GMM to evaluate the found clusters
- compare to clusters found with e.g. hierarchical clustering

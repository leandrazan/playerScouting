# playerScouting

In the pdf 'ClusteringDefenders', defenders that played in the English Championship season 22/23 are profiled through clustering.

Four groups are found, that characterise the players into 

- defenders with good positioning and 'safe' playing style (able to clear, block shots, win ground and aerial duels)
 while not taking too many risks (few tackles, fouls; high pass completion rates, few failed or dispossessed carries)
 (Groups 2 and 4)
- defenders with less safe playing style and positiong (more tackles and fouls, less blocked shots and clearances, 
 less good at arial and ground duels), more risk affine in general (also more crosses into penalty area) 
 (Group 3, also Group 1, but less clear as group 3)
 - defenders that have good ball playing qualities (high pass completion rates) and make progression through carries (group 2)
 vs more classical defenders (strong at defending, group 4), group 1 and 3 are balanced.
- some 'intelligent' tackling skills in group 1 (few fouls per tackle, while tackling frequently, few cards per 90)

To sum up, great defending skills, but fewer ball playing qualities are found in group 4, 
great defending skills and great ball playing qualities can be found in froup 2, 
group 1 is rather balanced, and group 3 has low pass completion rates andn rather poor defending skills,
tries to carry the ball a lot. 


## To do: try to adjust some of the defending metrics for ball possession.
